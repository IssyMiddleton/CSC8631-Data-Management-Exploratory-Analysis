Within the reports folder are stored the source RMarkdown documents (ending in .Rmd) and the output documents entitled Report.pdf and Overview-Presentation in PowerPoint format. These can be reproduced by using Knit on the RMarkdown source documents. The Overview Presentation uses the presentation template (.potx) for formatting.

By embedding sections of code within the reports they will automatically update if there are changes.
