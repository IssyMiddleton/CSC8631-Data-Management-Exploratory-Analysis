# Looking at the data - names, size, file types

![The files varied in size and type but were all related to a training course entitled Cyber Security: Safety at Home, Online, in Life.](Images/Files.jpg)

# Deciding an area of interest

I loaded sample data into RStudio and started looking at the data using R commands (head, summary, glimpse). It was possible to determine the size of the tables, the types of data that had been captured and see missing items. I decided to investigate studentsâ€™ willingness to share personal data at enrolment, given that the course was related to security. 

Sample row and columns:

```{r cyber.security.1_enrolments, echo = FALSE}
cyber.security.1_enrolments[1:3,2:4]
```

# Using ProjectTemplate
![To generate the necessary folders for my work, organise the files, load the R packages and data sets into memory I ran the ProjectTemplate scripts above. For more details about ProjectTemplate, see http://projecttemplate.net](Images/ProjectTemplateScript.jpg)

# Version control 

Syncing RStudio with my GitHub account allowed me to use Git for version control, by using Commit and Push. I created an new repository on GitHub, set up the security credentials under my profile and saved the public key into my version of RStudio. I downloaded Git and linked a new .RProj file. 

Git provides the functionality to control file versions and GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories.

# Pre-processing

The pre-processing scripts (or data munging code) are stored in `munge` folder and will be executed sequentially when load.project()` is called. Numbers within filenames indicate the sequential order of the scripts. The scripts:

- add columns at runtime, merge data sets and adjust data formats
- remove duplicate records where learner_id is not unique, calculating course duration between first and last enrolment date
- filters the data by groups of students willing to share data
- categorises data
- provides additional data items on duplicate records
- calculates volume of shared data items 
- determines counts and percentages of data that it shared by student, by survey
- and calculates counts and percentage of data that is not shared 

# Producing tables

In total, `r (enrolcount)` unique student enrolment records were assessed from seven survey files. 

Survey No.|    Date First Student Enrolled   | Date Last Student Enrolled       |Duration (days) | No. of Students
--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------| ----------
1   |  `r (cyber1firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber1laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber1durationdaysunique)` | `r (count1unique)`
2   |  `r (cyber2firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber2laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber2durationdaysunique)` | `r (count2unique)`
3   |  `r (cyber3firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber3laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber3durationdaysunique)` | `r (count3unique)`
4   |  `r (cyber4firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber4laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber4durationdaysunique)` | `r (count4unique)`
5   |  `r (cyber5firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber5laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber5durationdaysunique)` | `r (count5unique)`
6   |  `r (cyber6firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber6laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber6durationdaysunique)` | `r (count6unique)`
7   |  `r (cyber7firststudentreport)` | `r (cyber7laststudentreport)`|`r format(cyber7durationdaysunique)` | `r (count7unique)`

# Students sharing data

Of students that shared data at least one detail was `r format(Shared_Table_rows)`, which equates to `r (PercentSharing)` of total students. 

Survey No. | % of Students \* | Ave. Items \*
-----------|------------------------| ------------------------
1   |   `r (Percent1)`    | `r (Amount_Shared1)`  
2   |   `r (Percent2)`    | `r (Amount_Shared2)`    
3   |   `r (Percent3)`    | `r (Amount_Shared3)`
4   |   `r (Percent4)`    | `r (Amount_Shared4)`
5   |   `r (Percent5)`    | `r (Amount_Shared5)`
6   |   `r (Percent6)`    | `r (Amount_Shared6)`
7   |   `r (Percent7)`    | `r (Amount_Shared7)`
\* where students shared at least one of the five lifestyle details

Over the seven enrolments, the percentage of students sharing data dropped from almost 12% to under 8%. However for those students that did share data the amount of details they provided stayed fairly level at around an average of 4.7 items per student, dropping very marginally in the last intake to 4.6. Where students did share at least one, `r (PercentInfo5)`  of students provide all five requested details.

# Loading into an RMarkdown report

I used the RMarkdown file to generate a report to be stored in the Reports section of the project file structure. During the generation of graphs and tables I returned to the data preparation phase frequently. Regularly, I would update the Git version control by using a Commit and Push commands.
